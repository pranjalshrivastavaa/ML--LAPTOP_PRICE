# 💻 Laptop Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict laptop prices based on various specifications using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation to build an accurate predictive model.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Laptop_Price.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire workflow, including data preprocessing, EDA, model training, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python libraries required to run the notebook.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes various features of laptops such as:

- **Brand**: Manufacturer of the laptop.
- **Processor**: Type and generation of the CPU.
- **RAM**: Size of the memory in GB.
- **Storage**: Type (HDD/SSD) and capacity.
- **GPU**: Graphics processing unit details.
- **Operating System**: OS installed on the laptop.
- **Screen Size**: Size of the display in inches.
- **Price**: Target variable representing the laptop's price.

> **Note**: Ensure that the dataset is placed in the same directory as the notebook or update the path accordingly.

 ## 📈 Model Training & Evaluation
The notebook explores various regression algorithms to predict laptop prices, including:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost Regressor

Each model is trained and evaluated using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R²) score to determine the best-performing model.

## 📌 Results




After training and evaluating multiple models, the best-performing model achieved the following metrics:

R² Score: e.g., 0.92

MAE: e.g., $150

MSE: e.g., $30,000

Note: Replace the above metrics with actual results from your model evaluation.

## 🔍 Future Improvements





Hyperparameter Tuning: Implement techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to optimize model parameters.

Feature Engineering: Explore additional features or transformations to improve model performance.

Deployment: Develop a web application using frameworks like Flask or Streamlit to make predictions based on user input.
